THINGS THAT SITLL NEED TO HAPPEN

1. replace infowindow with the flex boxes on the right side of the screen that will come up, also, make the three top rated fridges the default.
2. figure out how to make excess information not show up (like museums, restaurants, etc.)
3. let the user see their own location on the map to find what is closest to them
4.find 4 small pin icons for 4 statuses (good, eh, bad, and unknown)
5. play around with api to see what settings users should have access to (as in how far away from our center can they move, can they get directions directly from the map or through the info card on the side, should they have control of map v satellite, i dont think they should be able to drop  person on the map anywhere, etc.)
6. figure out how to make addMarker() just take in a whole database, and perform the function on every line

THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript)
^ i taught myself all of this with the resources here / prior knowledge. if anyone knows a better way to do something feel free to change it!

1. figure out how to get an API key from google developer and use that to embed google maps (we are not using the iframe, it would have reduced out potential functionality way too much)
2. learn how to load the map onto the page with specific sizing (to leave room for infocards on the side)
3. make markers and give them coordinates, icons (I've not done this yet bc we need icons), and information.
4. place markers for all data we have atm
